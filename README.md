# Instagram Direct Messages Previewer

This project creates a Chrome extension that intercepts Instagram direct messages responses to preview them without marking them as read.

It explores the combination of `Typescript`, `React` and `Chrome Extensions` while reverse engineering Instagram's web requests and WebSocket communication.
